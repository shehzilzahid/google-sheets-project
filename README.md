# Google Sheets Project Pitch

I want to look at handicap accessibility in public restrooms at parks across New York City and correlate that against the median income of the neighborhoods where there are handicap accessible toilets and where there aren't. I'm also interested in learning why certain park toilets have been renovated as required by the American Disability Act, as opposed to others are still non-compliant.
